Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a private, container image registry. With Amazon ECR, you can create multiple repositories to store and share your container images. To make it easier to deploy your containerized application, Amazon ECR integrates with other AWS servicesâ€”such as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and AWS Lambda.
