> [!abstract] Abstract
> Developed a fully customized user interface to model and simulate the evolution of cities using cellular automata governed by tailored rules. These rules were derived from an in-depth analysis of data from dozens of cities, focusing on changes in industrial, commercial, residential, green, and vacant areas, and assessing the impact of sustainable and unsustainable urban policies. This project was featured in a bachelorâ€™s thesis which later was awarded with honors.

The rapid pace of urban growth highlights the need to plan and manage land in a sustainable way. Theoretical studies on land management for urban growth have historically focused on understanding the relationship between commerce, industry, and residential areas, only recently incorporating natural elements such as green spaces. In this context, a cellular automata-based urban growth model was developed to integrate natural elements into theoretical urban modeling.

To achieve this, four hypothetical cities, created through an analysis of green space distribution in megacities, were subjected to two general public policy frameworks: one reflecting a policy with sustainable tendencies, where green spaces and residential areas were prioritized over other land uses, and another reflecting a policy with unsustainable tendencies, where industry and commerce were heavily favored over other land uses.

The distribution of green spaces in all cities was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as the accessibility of these spaces from residential cells. The findings revealed that, in cities modeled with unsustainable parameters, commerce and industry grew exponentially, leading to the near-total loss of green spaces. Conversely, cities modeled with sustainable parameters developed multiple green spaces of varying sizes and levels of connectivity. Moreover, in these cities, residential access to green spaces was absolute by the final iteration.

This study aims to contribute to the established field of theoretical urban modeling by incorporating relevant aspects into a global context increasingly affected by socio-environmental crises.
