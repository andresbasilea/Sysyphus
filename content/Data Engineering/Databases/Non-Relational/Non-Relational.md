A non-relational database is a type of database that does not store data in tables but instead in whatever format is best for the data being stored. It normally contains unstructured data. Non-relational databases are said to be NoSQL, meaning they do not use SQL.

Some types of non-relational databases are:
- **Key value stores**: Data is assigned a unique identifier, which allows it to be retrieved. 
- **Column-family data stores**: Data is organized in a "keyspace" containing multiple families of different columns.![[Pasted image 20241201144459.png]] An example of this type of database is Apache Cassandra.
- **Graph Databases**: Graph databases store data in nodes and structures them based on their relationships to one another.
- **Document databases**: Store data within documents, which typically contain one object and all its associated metadata. 

Common NoSQL databases include:
- MongoDB
- Apache Cassandra
- Amazon DynamoDB
