AWS App Runner provides a way to run your containerized application on AWS infrastructure. You only need to supply a container image or application source to App Runner. App Runner creates all the infrastructure needed to host your application, and it also supplies you with an HTTP endpoint. App Runner serves your application with end-to-end encryption. As load increases, it will also scale within parameters that you define.
