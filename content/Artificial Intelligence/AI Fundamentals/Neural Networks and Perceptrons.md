A **Neural Network (NN)** is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (**neurons**) that process information and learn patterns from data.

ðŸ”¹ **Structure:**

- **Input Layer:** Receives raw data.
- **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations and feature extraction.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Concepts:**

- **Weights & Biases:** Control the strength of connections between neurons.
- **Activation Functions:** Determine whether a neuron "fires" (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
- **Backpropagation:** A learning algorithm that adjusts weights using **gradient descent**.

A **Perceptron** is the simplest form of a neural network, introduced by **Frank Rosenblatt (1958)**. It is a **single-layer** model used for binary classification.

ðŸ”¹ **How it Works:**

1. Takes **input features** (e.g., pixel values in an image).
2. Applies **weights and biases**.
3. Uses an **activation function** (e.g., step function) to decide the output (0 or 1).

ðŸ”¹ **Limitations of Perceptrons:**

- Can only solve **linearly separable problems** (e.g., AND, OR).
- Cannot handle complex tasks like XOR (fixed by multi-layer networks).

- **Neural Networks = Multi-layer models capable of learning complex patterns.**
- **Deep Learning = Neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks).**
