> These are notes I have been taking while reading the book *Designing Data Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann


Companies:
- Need to create tools to handle scale
- Need to be agile, test hypothesis cheaply, and respond quickly to market insights by keeping development cycles short and data models flexible.
- You can now build systems that are distributed across many machines and even multiple regions, thanks to IaaS such as Amazon Web Services.

Data intensive applications:
	- Reliability: 
		- Tolerating HW and SW faults
	- Scalability: 
		- Measuring load and performance.
		- Latency percentiles, throughput
	- Maintainability:
		- Operability, simplicity and evolvability



Many applications need to:
- Store data (databases)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation (caches)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter (search indexes)
- Send messages to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)
