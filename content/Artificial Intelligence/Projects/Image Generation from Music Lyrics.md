> [!abstract] Abstract
> This project proposes the use of adversarial neural networks in natural language processing to generate images that represent the feelings and emotions expressed in song lyrics. Generating images from text requires understanding and analyzing the emotional content of the lyrics and subsequently synthesizing images that evoke those emotions. A DistilRoBERTa model fine-tuned for emotion classification was used, and images were generated with adversarial neural networks trained on subsets of the WikiArt dataset.
