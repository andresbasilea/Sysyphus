> [!abstract] Abstract
> Created an application where the functionality of certain artificial intelligence algorithms can be demonstrated. The algorithms implemented include: distance metrics, association rules, hierarchical and partitional clustering, classification using logistic regression, and decision trees for classification and forecasting.
> The use of an application like this would be to have a single application from where you could load data and apply different AI models to that data, in search of the optimum model to forecast or classify the data.
