##### 3 v's of Big Data: 
- Volume
- Velocity (ingest, analyzed, visualized)
- Variety (types of data processed)

#### Data Warehouse
- Contains data that is structured and/or processed. Ready to use data. Rigid data that is normally easy to understand, but less up-to-date.

#### Data Lake
- Raw and unstructured data, normally before transformation or organization. Flexible data, no structure is enforced.

#### OLTP vs OLAP
- OLTP: On-Line Transactional Processing. Processes high volume of short transactions. Fast queries, high integrity. Modifications of database. 
- OLAP: On-Line Analytical Processing. Low volume of long-running queries, aggregated historical data. 

	**Normally, ETL process takes data from OLTP system and moves it into OLAP system**

#### Batch vs Streaming
- Batch: Data gathered within a window of time, large volume of data. 
- Streaming: Continuous collection of data. 

#### Data processing pipelines
Stages of a pipeline: Ingestion, storage, processing and visualization. 

### Sharding

### Replication 

### Latency

### CAP Theorem 

### Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking
