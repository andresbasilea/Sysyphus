> [!abstract] Abstract
> An economically free society is that in which its individuals are free to produce, work, consume and invest in any way they please. There are few published articles that use data mining and artificial intelligence techniques to determine the relationship between economic freedom and other sociological metrics in a country. In this study, we present a statistical and AI analysis of the correlation between different sociological metrics and the economic freedom of a country, with the main purpose of integrating data from different sociological  metrics in such a way that it can lead to a better understanding of the implications that economic freedom has in the overall well-being of an individual inside a country. The approach to the analysis consisted on a variable selection process using the Pearson correlation matrix, then analyzing the correlation between different variables and finally building a Random Forest Regressor to predict happiness and crime values using 14 economic variables. The Random Forest Regressor models created presented an r2 score of 85%. These models show the relationship between the economic and societal factors in a country and they could be used to help define economic, security or social policies.
