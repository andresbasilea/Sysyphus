You start by checking out the main branch, and pulling any new changes to the code to your local workspace. You can then switch to the feature branch with your changes and merge in any new code from the main branch (ensuring you have the latest changes from the main branch included in your branch). Once any merge conflicts have been resolved, you can push your local branch to your remote repo (you can create a new branch in the remote repo to track your local branch). Finally, you create a pull request.

### In summary:
- You make pull requests in the last two steps of the Git Feature Branch Workflow
- You should always create a new feature branch to develop in
- You need to remember to always pull updated code from main before creating a pull request
- You should delete the feature branch after the branch is merged.
