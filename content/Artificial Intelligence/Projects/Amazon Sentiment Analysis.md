> [!abstract] Abstract
> In recent years, text analysis has become an interesting area of research. Coupled with the increasing popularity of e-commerce, we can identify a need or opportunity in sentiment analysis based on online product reviews. This project proposes various methods for analyzing reviews of products for the benefit of companies, focusing on the analysis of reviews for the benefit of our own company, specifically in the development of electric water heaters. Therefore, we propose the use of DistilBERT as a model for review analysis to classify them based on star ratings. This way, a company can have better control over the quality of its products, as well as improve the sales process, warranty, and customer service.
