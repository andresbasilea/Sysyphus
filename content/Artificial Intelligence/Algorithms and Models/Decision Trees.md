## **Decision Trees**

🔹 **Type:** Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)  
🔹 **Best For:** Interpretable models, structured data

### **How it Works:**

- A tree-like structure where each node represents a decision rule.
- Splits data into subsets based on **features** (e.g., age, income).
- The final leaf nodes give the output (classification label or regression value).

### **Pros:**

✅ Easy to interpret and visualize  
✅ Handles categorical & numerical data  
✅ Works well with small to medium datasets

### **Cons:**

❌ Prone to **overfitting** (high variance)  
❌ Can be unstable (small changes in data → different trees)

### **Example:**

- **Loan approval** – Decides if a customer gets a loan based on income, credit score, etc.
- **Medical diagnosis** – Classifies diseases based on symptoms.
