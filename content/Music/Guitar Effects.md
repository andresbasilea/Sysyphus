### Using Guitarix, Ardour and Cadence for guitar effects

> [!abstract] Abstract
> I love playing guitar... but guitar effects are extremely expensive, and they have a certain property that, once you buy one, you want to buy more and more! 
> To save money on effects, and to put my computer engineering degree to use, I thought "why can't I program my own effects?". And even though I have made that before (I made a guitar *looper* program that loops whatever base track I am playing so that I can play on top), I decided that this time I was going to take it easy and see what open source projects were out there. That's how I found about Guitarix, Ardour and Cadence and how you can make them work together to fulfill the dream of any guitar player: having unlimited guitar effects! 
> I will leave the tutorial of installing and using these open source software for later, but I can say that putting together these programs so that I could use them was not an easy task!
