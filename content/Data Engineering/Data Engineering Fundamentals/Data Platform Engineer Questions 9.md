### **1. You need to handle GDPR data deletion requests in a distributed pipeline with multiple storage layers. How do you design the solution?**

**Answer**:

1. **Centralized Deletion Framework**:
    - Implement a service to handle deletion requests, logging the user ID and affected data systems.
2. **Data Lineage**:
    - Use tools like **Apache Atlas** or **Amundsen** to track where the user's data resides.
3. **Deletion Process**:
    - **Transactional Systems**: Delete data directly from databases.
    - **Immutable Systems (e.g., S3)**: Use lifecycle policies to mark and delete data.
    - **Derived Data**: Reprocess aggregations to exclude deleted users.
4. **Batch vs. Real-Time**:
    - Use a batch job for scheduled deletions or event-driven triggers for immediate processing.
5. **Validation**:
    - Automate tests to verify data deletion across systems.

**Challenges**: Ensuring consistent deletion in replicated and cached layers. Use TTL policies and invalidate caches.

### **2. Your data pipeline needs to integrate with a legacy system that exports CSV files daily. The system occasionally delivers corrupted or incomplete files. How do you handle this?**

**Answer**:

1. **File Validation**:
    - Verify the schema (e.g., column count, data types).
    - Perform checksum validation for file integrity.
2. **Error Handling**:
    - Reject corrupt files and log errors for manual intervention.
    - Notify stakeholders with automated alerts.
3. **Retries**:
    - Implement retries with exponential backoff to re-fetch missing files.
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Use the most recent valid file as a fallback.
    - Log differences between expected and actual files.
5. **Automation**:
    - Use an orchestration tool (e.g., Airflow) to handle retries, validations, and downstream dependencies.

### **3. A key Kafka topic is growing rapidly, leading to high storage costs and degraded consumer performance. How do you address this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Retention Policies**:
    - Reduce the log retention period if data is no longer needed.
    - Archive older data to cheaper storage like S3.
2. **Topic Partitioning**:
    - Increase the number of partitions to improve parallelism for consumers.
3. **Compaction**:
    - Enable log compaction for topics where only the latest message for a key is relevant.
4. **Consumer Optimization**:
    - Use filtering at the consumer level to process only relevant messages.
    - Implement batch processing instead of single-message processing.
5. **Monitoring**:
    - Use Kafka monitoring tools (e.g., Confluent Control Center, Prometheus) to track usage and trends.

### **4. Your data team receives complaints about stale data in a dashboard powered by a daily ETL job. How do you make the pipeline near real-time?**

**Answer**:

1. **Streaming Layer**:
    - Use Kafka or Kinesis to ingest and process events in real-time.
    - Replace or augment the batch job with stream processing using Spark Structured Streaming or Flink.
2. **Incremental Updates**:
    - Load only new or updated records into the data warehouse using CDC (Change Data Capture) tools like **Debezium**.
3. **Hybrid Approach**:
    - Process critical data in real-time and less critical data in nightly batch jobs.
4. **Storage Optimization**:
    - Use Snowflake or BigQuery to handle fast incremental writes and updates.
5. **Impact Analysis**:
    - Communicate with stakeholders about latency trade-offs and the complexity of real-time updates.

### **5. A pipeline processing IoT sensor data in real-time has occasional spikes, leading to dropped events. How do you address this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Buffering**:
    - Introduce a message queue like Kafka to decouple ingestion from processing.
2. **Autoscaling**:
    - Enable auto-scaling for your processing engine (e.g., Spark Structured Streaming, AWS Lambda).
3. **Backpressure Handling**:
    - Implement flow control in the processing layer to pause ingestion during spikes.
4. **Event Prioritization**:
    - Assign priority to critical events and process them first.
5. **Data Recovery**:
    - Use Kafka replay capabilities to reprocess dropped events during downtime.

### **6. You notice significant data skew during aggregations in a Spark job, causing some tasks to run much longer. How do you resolve this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Skew Detection**:
    - Analyze key distributions to identify skewed partitions using Spark UI or profiling.
2. **Salting**:
    - Add random salts to the keys to redistribute load, then remove salts post-aggregation.
3. **Repartitioning**:
    - Use custom partitioning to ensure even data distribution.
4. **Combine Operations**:
    - Aggregate data locally (reduce by key) before shuffling to minimize data transfer.
5. **Resource Allocation**:
    - Allocate more executors or cores to tasks handling larger partitions.

### **7. A machine learning pipeline outputs large models that need to be versioned and shared across teams. How do you design a solution?**

**Answer**:

1. **Model Registry**:
    - Use tools like MLflow or SageMaker Model Registry to store, version, and track models.
2. **Storage**:
    - Save model artifacts in object storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) with unique version identifiers.
3. **Metadata Tracking**:
    - Store metadata (e.g., training data version, hyperparameters) alongside the model.
4. **Access Control**:
    - Use role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure proper model access permissions.
5. **Deployment**:
    - Enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines for model promotion to staging or production.

### **8. A data warehouse query is consistently timing out for large datasets. How do you resolve this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Query Optimization**:
    - Simplify queries by breaking them into smaller, materialized intermediate steps.
    - Use proper indexing and partition pruning for selective data access.
2. **Data Partitioning**:
    - Partition large tables by frequently queried columns (e.g., date).
3. **Clustering**:
    - Apply clustering or sort keys (e.g., Snowflake clustering) to optimize query performance.
4. **Caching**:
    - Cache intermediate results using tools like Redis or materialized views.
5. **Warehousing**:
    - Scale up or scale out your warehouse instance for improved compute capacity.

### **9. Your pipeline needs to process sensitive PII data and anonymize it before loading into a shared analytics platform. How do you implement this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Encryption**:
    - Encrypt data at rest and in transit using tools like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault.
2. **Anonymization Techniques**:
    - Use hashing or tokenization to replace sensitive fields with irreversible identifiers.
    - Aggregate or generalize data to remove individual-level details.
3. **Data Classification**:
    - Tag sensitive fields using metadata for automated anonymization.
4. **Data Masking**:
    - Apply dynamic masking for real-time analytics queries.
5. **Access Controls**:
    - Limit access to raw data and enforce anonymized views for analytics teams.

### **10. An external vendor sends inconsistent data formats, breaking your pipeline periodically. How do you handle this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Schema Validation**:
    - Define strict schema expectations (e.g., JSON, Avro) and reject non-conforming data.
2. **Normalization**:
    - Implement a preprocessing layer to standardize data formats before further processing.
3. **Versioning**:
    - Work with the vendor to introduce schema versioning for backward compatibility.
4. **Monitoring**:
    - Set up alerts for schema mismatches or invalid data formats.
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Redirect invalid data to a quarantine area for manual review.
