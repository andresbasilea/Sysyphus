### **1. Your company is acquiring another business, and you need to integrate their data systems with your existing pipelines. What’s your approach?**

**Answer**:

1. **Assessment**:
    - Inventory the acquired company’s data assets (e.g., databases, warehouses, pipelines).
    - Identify overlaps, schema differences, and unique requirements.
2. **Data Mapping**:
    - Define mappings between schemas, focusing on business-critical tables first.
    - Handle data type mismatches, naming conventions, and key alignment.
3. **Integration Pipeline**:
    - Use ETL tools like AWS Glue or Informatica for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
    - Decouple the pipelines to allow gradual integration and reduce risks.
4. **Data Quality**:
    - Apply data profiling and validation to ensure consistency and accuracy.
    - Address duplicate or conflicting records (e.g., deduplication, conflict resolution rules).
5. **Security and Compliance**:
    - Ensure data access policies align with regulatory requirements.
    - Mask or encrypt sensitive fields during integration.

### **2. A business-critical pipeline depends on a third-party API, which recently introduced rate limits, causing delays. What’s your solution?**

**Answer**:

1. **API Rate Management**:
    - Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to throttle requests within the API's allowance.
    - Use token buckets or leaky bucket algorithms to manage requests.
2. **Data Caching**:
    - Cache frequent requests (e.g., in Redis) to reduce dependency on the API.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
    - Decouple ingestion from processing using queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
    - Queue requests and process them in batches to stay within rate limits.
4. **Parallelism**:
    - Use multiple API keys/accounts if allowed by the provider to increase throughput.
5. **Fallback**:
    - Pre-fetch critical data during off-peak hours or provide cached results if the API is unavailable.

### **3. Your data lake has grown significantly, and query performance has degraded. How would you improve it?**

**Answer**:

1. **Partitioning**:
    - Partition datasets by frequently queried fields (e.g., date or region).
    - Use Hive-style partitioning for tools like Spark or Athena.
2. **File Format Optimization**:
    - Convert data to columnar formats like Parquet or ORC for faster reads.
    - Compact small files into larger ones to reduce overhead.
3. **Indexing and Metadata**:
    - Enable indexing with tools like Apache Hudi or Delta Lake.
    - Use Glue Catalog or AWS Lake Formation for centralized metadata management.
4. **Caching**:
    - Cache commonly queried datasets in distributed memory systems like Redis or Alluxio.
5. **Query Optimization**:
    - Optimize SQL queries with predicate pushdowns and projection pruning.

### **4. A Spark job processing a large dataset is consistently running out of memory. How do you address this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Memory Tuning**:
    - Increase executor memory and adjust driver memory allocation.
    - Set **spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold** to prevent large broadcasts.
2. **Efficient Operations**:
    - Avoid wide transformations (e.g., `groupBy`) without pre-aggregations.
    - Use `mapPartitions` instead of `map` to reduce task overhead.
3. **Data Partitioning**:
    - Increase the number of partitions to distribute the workload evenly.
    - Use `repartition` or `coalesce` intelligently to manage shuffle size.
4. **Shuffle Optimization**:
    - Store shuffle data on disks with high IOPS.
    - Adjust `spark.shuffle.spill` settings to avoid memory overflow.
5. **Checkpointing**:
    - Break long jobs into smaller stages and checkpoint intermediate results.

### **5. An ETL job frequently fails due to schema changes in the source database. How do you handle this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Schema Validation**:
    - Use tools like AWS Glue or Spark's schema inference to detect changes dynamically.
    - Maintain a versioned schema registry for consistent schema evolution.
2. **Schema Adaptation**:
    - Implement logic to handle schema drift (e.g., adding new columns dynamically).
    - Use nullable fields in downstream systems to accommodate changes.
3. **Alerting**:
    - Set up automated alerts to notify the team of schema changes.
4. **Backward Compatibility**:
    - Test downstream pipelines against older schema versions to ensure compatibility.
5. **Staging Area**:
    - Load raw data into a staging layer first for inspection and transformation.

### **6. A business requirement mandates joining two large datasets daily, but the process is slow. How would you optimize it?**

**Answer**:

1. **Partitioned Joins**:
    - Partition both datasets by the join key and ensure partitions align.
2. **Broadcast Joins**:
    - Use broadcast joins if one dataset is small enough to fit into memory.
3. **Bucketing**:
    - Bucket datasets by the join key to reduce shuffle operations.
4. **Pre-Aggregation**:
    - Aggregate data before joining to reduce the size of datasets.
5. **Efficient Formats**:
    - Store datasets in columnar formats (e.g., Parquet) for faster access.

### **7. You need to design a pipeline for near-real-time fraud detection using transaction data. How would you approach this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Ingestion**:
    - Use Kafka or Kinesis to ingest transaction data in real-time.
2. **Processing**:
    - Apply stream processing with Apache Flink or Spark Structured Streaming for fraud rules.
    - Use machine learning models deployed with TensorFlow Serving for anomaly detection.
3. **Storage**:
    - Store processed data in a low-latency database (e.g., DynamoDB or Cassandra).
4. **Alerting**:
    - Trigger alerts for suspicious transactions via SNS or PagerDuty.
5. **Feedback Loop**:
    - Continuously retrain fraud detection models using flagged and verified transactions.

### **8. Your team reports inconsistent timestamp formats in the pipeline, causing aggregation mismatches. How do you resolve this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Standardization**:
    - Convert all timestamps to a standard format (e.g., ISO 8601) at the ingestion layer.
    - Use libraries like Python’s `datetime` or Spark’s `to_timestamp` for transformations.
2. **Time Zones**:
    - Normalize timestamps to UTC before processing.
3. **Validation**:
    - Implement validation checks to detect and log non-standard formats.
4. **Auditing**:
    - Track timestamp conversions with metadata for debugging.
5. **Communication**:
    - Collaborate with data producers to enforce consistent timestamp formats.

### **9. A batch pipeline needs to run within a tight SLA, but external dependencies like API calls are slowing it down. How do you mitigate this?**

**Answer**:

1. **Parallelization**:
    - Split the workload into parallel tasks to reduce runtime.
2. **Asynchronous Calls**:
    - Use asynchronous processing for API calls.
3. **Caching**:
    - Cache frequent API responses to avoid redundant requests.
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Provide default values or cached results if API calls fail or delay.
5. **Prioritization**:
    - Process critical data first to meet SLA requirements.

### **10. A data scientist reports that historical data for a critical feature is missing. How do you backfill the data?**

**Answer**:

1. **Identify Source**:
    - Determine the original source of the missing data.
2. **Extract Historical Data**:
    - Retrieve data from backups, logs, or external systems.
3. **Backfill Process**:
    - Use a separate pipeline to process and insert the missing data.
    - Ensure backfilled data adheres to the same schema and quality standards.
4. **Impact Analysis**:
    - Assess the impact of backfilled data on downstream systems and reprocess if necessary.
5. **Prevent Recurrence**:
    - Add data validation checks to identify and resolve missing data early.
