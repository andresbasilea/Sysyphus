> [!abstract] Abstract
> The project involves implementing various models capable of performing facial recognition from images. Among these methods, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of image features, as well as SVC, MLP, and CNN models for facial recognition. Finally, a comparison between these models is made, and a practical application is tested using Convolutional Neural Networks, the DeepFace library, and the VGG-Face model.
